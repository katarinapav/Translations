# Translations Introduction
In our efforts to engage as much of the community as possible, we would like to begin translating large portions of the ZelCash ecosystem that are necessary for understanding the project from front to back. We have run a small translation campaign previously for the Zel Teaser video, with community members translating the script into over 15 languages and it was a fantastic group effort and experience. 

This time around, we are opening up the campaign with a bounty program. Below is a list of scripts in English for various ZelCash information sources that we would like translated to as many languages as possible. Each script has an associated bounty of Zel for a successful and accepted translation.

We will maintain a list on Discord of which member has started translating which language to try to avoid two or more people working on the same file for the same language (there is only one complete set of bounty pay for each language).

Required languages are below. If you would like a language not on the list and can provide some translation, please DM me on Discord "Parker/trial123" or send me an email at [Parker](mailto:parker.honeyman@zel.cash)  

**More translation jobs will follow**

# How it works
We are using Github for translations for multiple reasons, but most being that it is probably the most accessible platform for most users that also has revision control. So the requirements for translating are that you would need a Github account (free) and minimal knowledge of how it functions. You can make your own fork of the translation documents, or just upload the translation files and I will combine them.

Please follow the formatting of the original English script so that we can index all the translations and add them to the project much quicker. **Please use tabs (not spaces) between the section #s and the translated text for easy parsing**  
For example, here is a snippet of an English script:
```
1	***Top Section***
1.1	Home - About - Roadmap
1.2	We are proud to present
```

The translated file for Spanish will look like (Google Translate so I know it could be incorrect :/):
```
1	*** Secci√≥n superior ***
1.1	Inicio - Acerca de - Hoja de ruta
1.2	Estamos orgullosos de presentar
```

So please follow the formatting of the original file with the translated text and make sure to name your file with the script name and language.
